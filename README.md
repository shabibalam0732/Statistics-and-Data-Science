## Introduction to Design and Analysis of Experiment
### Seoul Bike Demand
In this analysis, a linear regression model was initially built using the variables Hour, Temperature..C., Humidity..., Wind.speed..m.s., Visibility..10m., Dew.point.temperature..C., Solar.Radiation..MJ.m2., Rainfall.mm., Snowfall..cm., Holiday, Functioning.Day, and Seasons to predict the Rented.Bike.Count in Seoul. The model's diagnostics revealed issues of multicollinearity, especially with Temperature..C., Dew.point.temperature..C., and Seasons showing high Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs). Subsequently, a backward stepwise regression was performed to address multicollinearity, resulting in the removal of the Visibility..10m. variable. Then, a Box-Cox transformation was applied to the response variable Rented.Bike.Count to address heteroscedasticity and non-normality in the residuals. The transformed model demonstrated an improvement in the adjusted R-squared value from 0.5497 to 0.7253, indicating a better fit to the data. Since p value is lower of Temperature, windspeed, and snowfall, I remove those variable to make my model more effective. Additionally, diagnostic plots showed improved linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality assumptions in the transformed model compared to the original model. Overall, these steps helped in refining the model's performance and addressing issues related to multicollinearity and non-normality in the data.
### Mental Health
This project examines how different types of alcoholic beverages affect memory performance using a Latin Square design. The study involved 125 male participants aged 21 and above from a virtual island. Each participant consumed 500ml of one of five alcoholic beverages: light beer, regular beer, Guinness, red wine, or white wine. Memory performance was assessed using the Memory Card Test before and after consumption.
The analysis employed ANOVA and post-hoc tests to determine any significant differences in memory performance across the different beverage types. The results indicated no significant differences, suggesting that the type of alcoholic beverage does not significantly impact memory performance. Instead, it implies that the quantity of alcohol consumed is a more critical factor in affecting cognitive functions. These findings highlight the importance of focusing on alcohol quantity in public health messaging regarding cognitive health. Future research should include a broader demographic and additional cognitive tests to provide a more comprehensive understanding of alcohol's impact on cognition.
