### Seoul Bike Demand
In this analysis, a linear regression model was initially built using the variables Hour, Temperature..C., Humidity..., Wind.speed..m.s., Visibility..10m., Dew.point.temperature..C., Solar.Radiation..MJ.m2., Rainfall.mm., Snowfall..cm., Holiday, Functioning.Day, and Seasons to predict the Rented.Bike.Count in Seoul. The model's diagnostics revealed issues of multicollinearity, especially with Temperature..C., Dew.point.temperature..C., and Seasons showing high Variance Inflation Factors (VIFs). Subsequently, a backward stepwise regression was performed to address multicollinearity, resulting in the removal of the Visibility..10m. variable. Then, a Box-Cox transformation was applied to the response variable Rented.Bike.Count to address heteroscedasticity and non-normality in the residuals. The transformed model demonstrated an improvement in the adjusted R-squared value from 0.5497 to 0.7253, indicating a better fit to the data. Since p value is lower of Temperature, windspeed, and snowfall, I remove those variable to make my model more effective. Additionally, diagnostic plots showed improved linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality assumptions in the transformed model compared to the original model. Overall, these steps helped in refining the model's performance and addressing issues related to multicollinearity and non-normality in the data.
